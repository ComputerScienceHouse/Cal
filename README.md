# Cal - [calendar.csh.rit.edu](https://calendar.csh.rit.edu)

The public facing website for [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://rit.edu/)'s [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu). A re-work for CSH's standard google calendar display.

## Overview

This site is written using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [EJS](https://ejs.co/) to render the templates, and uses Sass and JavaScript ES6.

## Local Development

#### Prerequisites:
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Instructions

(You need the secrets to run locally, contact me for more information)

The site should now serve locally at `localhost:4000`, and auto-build when you change/create files in the repo!
